## ðŸ—’ Description

This is a framework for building new contracts using serverless lambdas.
This framework was built out of the [AWS Frameworks](<AWS_SDK_ADDRESSS>), and 
it's designed for `curl` CLIs with a few methods options, deployed on Amazon S3.


## ðŸš€ Getting Started Tutorial

This is a step-by-step guide to introduce you to this API. If you have not developed anything in a command line before, this tutorial is a great place to get started.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gbs0/aws-rest-api.git
```

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

Currently, Node 8+ and 12+ is supported. We support [curl](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases). You can add the [-X](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node) actions (`POST` or `GET`) to your CLI to ensure that all data il'be send for a specific lambda function.

## ðŸŒˆ CLI Types

With this API you can create 2 different CLI types, POST and GET.

Single CLIs are like `ls` or `cat`. They can accept arguments and flags. 
See more of then for [optionally retrieve other methods](https://github.com/oclif/command).

CLIs are like `git` or `heroku`. They have commands that are themselves single CLIs. In the `src` folder there are files that points to a lambda function. This directory contains the main files for the CLI. For `models`, you would have a project like the following:

```
package.json
models/
â””â”€â”€â”œâ”€â”€ approvalModel.json
   â”œâ”€â”€ creationModel.json
 Â Â â””â”€â”€ uploadModel.json
src/
â””â”€â”€â”œâ”€â”€ approvalGet.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ approvalGet.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ approvalGet.json
   â”œâ”€â”€ approvalGet.js
   â”œâ”€â”€ approvalGet.js
 Â Â â””â”€â”€ destroy.ts
```
