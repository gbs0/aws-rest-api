## ðŸ—’ Description

This is a framework for building new contracts using serverless lambdas.
This framework was built out of the [AWS Frameworks](<AWS_SDK_ADDRESSS>), and 
it's designed for `curl` CLIs with a few methods options, deployed on Amazon S3.


## ðŸš€ Getting Started Tutorial

This is a step-by-step guide to introduce you to this API. If you have not developed anything in a command line before, this tutorial is a great place to get started.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/gbs0/aws-rest-api.git
```

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

Currently, Node 8+ and 12+ is supported. We support [curl](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases). You can add the [-X](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node) actions (`POST` or `GET`) to your CLI to ensure that all data il'be send for a specific lambda function.

## ðŸŒˆ CLI Types

With this API you can create 2 different CLI types, POST and GET.

Single CLIs are like `ls` or `cat`. They can accept arguments and flags. 
See more of then for [optionally retrieve other methods](https://github.com/oclif/command).

Multi CLIs are like `git` or `heroku`. They have subcommands that are themselves single CLIs. In the `package.json` there is a field `oclif.commands` that points to a directory. This directory contains all the subcommands for the CLI. For example, if you had a CLI called `mycli` with the commands `mycli create` and `mycli destroy`, you would have a project like the following:

```
package.json
getItemP/
â””â”€â”€ commands/
 Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ create.ts
 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ destroy.ts
```

Multi-command CLIs may also include [plugins](https://oclif.io/docs/plugins).
